### What is it?

Bi-creator is a tool for creating bi-packages - extensions for project called [Breath OS](https://breathos.github.io/). Find software that you use on a daily basis and configurations for it, then build a bi-package using this tool and share it with others!

### How can it be helpful?

Having some package that contains everything that you usually use on your device, for example, for work can be very handy, when it is required to setup a fresh computer. So, do it now and create a package with everything that you need in a one pack use deploy on every machine, or even in cloud! Do not forget, to share you package with others: may be someone will find it helpful, too and thank you for it.
